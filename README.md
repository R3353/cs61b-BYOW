## Paired programming contributions:
- Built code to communicate with computer keyboard in `Engine.java`
- Implemented world building, pseudorandom seed world generator, avatar movement, avatar creation, game replay and resuming, loading screen, ending screen features in `World.java`
- Tile and avatar designs in `Tileset.java`

## Disclaimers
This repository is intended for **portfolio and professional demonstration purposes only**.

All code was originally written by my partner and me during my time in CS61B at UC Berkeley. It has been modified and published here to demonstrate my coding knowledge.

**Please do not reference or reuse this code if you are currently enrolled in CS61B** or any similar course. Doing so violates academic integrity policies.
